        In November 2018, Frisco ISD voters approved a $691 million bond
        package to provide funding to build four new schools and maintain
        and repair existing facilities. Funds will also provide additional
        resources for classroom technology and school security, as well as
        additional student opportunities in academics, fine arts and
        athletics. The bond program is intended to take the District through
        72,000 students or the end of the 2025-26 school year.
        </p>

        The bond program was developed in spring and summer 2018 by the
        Facilities &amp; Programs Evaluation Committee, an advisory group of
        FISD community members, parents, students and staff. Included
        projects were studied and recommended by the committee, which
        evaluated student enrollment projections, school building capacities
        and potential facility and maintenance projects. The committee&rsquo;s
        work was the continuation of a two-year effort to engage the
        community in the District&rsquo;s planning and decision-making process.
        The bond program received the support of 61 percent of voters.
